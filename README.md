The R package macs implements recursive partitioning based, nonparametric methods for high dimensional regression and classification. Depending on the aims of data analysis as well as the structures of the data, macs provides three major functions. When the response variable is continuous, whether it is repeatedly measured or not, Multivariate Adaptive Splines for Analysis of Longitudinal Data (masal) is available in macs. When the response variable is categorical, whether it is one or multi-dimensional, rtree in macs can be used to construct classification trees. Finally, stree in macs can handle censored data to build survival trees. Our package also provides visual features to assist the users in understanding the output.
